This is a voting app. This is a simple voting app bulit with react. I had a lot of fun making this. I'm working through a book and I'm learning a lot.



### Running the app

1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.

Follow the instructions for your platform [here](https://github.com/npm/npm).

2. Install `http-server`

````
npm install
````

3. Boot the HTTP server

````
npm run server
````

The server is now running at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)
